### Major Activities 

This  project focus on forecasting solution of time-dependent PDEâ€™s based on a snapshot decomposition method. The idea is to approximate the PDE solution $$u(t,x)$$  as a linear combination of orthonormal modes (SVD of the snapshot matrix):

$$u(t,x)=\sum_{j=1}^r U_j \alpha_j(t)$$

A neural network is then used to fit the time-dependent coefficients ($$\alpha_r(t):$$ $$r$$ dimensional output) at different time instants ($$1$$ dimensional inputs). However, this approach can only predict solution within the training data set and fails at forecasting the solution  accurately at a future time instant (i.e outside the training data set). In order to deal with this issue, we incorporate a physics term in the loss function which is the discretized equation for $$\alpha(t)$$.  Fig. 1 below shows the effect of incorporating such a constraint.  

### Significant Results

For demonstration, we consider the linear advection equation driven by an external force. A time-varying boundary condition is adopted and only the first two dominant modes are considered in approximating the solution. The forecasted solution is shown below. It is clear that
one can forecast the solution accurately at a future time instant by encding the physics into the learning process.
