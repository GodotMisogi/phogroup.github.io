### Aims<a name="aims"></a>

#### Aims 1: Develop rigorous and adaptive architecture design for deep learning
One of the key challenges in adapting deep learning methods to science and engineering problems is how to
determine the architecture of deep learning for the problem under consideration. Leveraging well-developed applied math techniques to develop rigorous approaches for architecture design.

#### Aims 2: Develop model-constrained deep learning methods for forward and inverse simulations
Many data-driven science and engineering problems governed by physic laws,
e.g. governing equations have limited experimental or
observational data. In this case, pure data-driven deep learning approaches
are prone to
over-fitting and thus not capable of respecting the mathematical models. Capitalizing on our decade of experience on large-scale forward simulations, we shall develop model-constrained deep neural network methods to encode the underlying mathematical models in order to obtain fast and accurate forward and inverse solutions.

#### Aims 3: Develop model-constrained  uncertainty quantification for deep learning  
Most, if not all, deep learning approaches  do not
  take into account the variability in the  data and the
  uncertainty in training, and neither do they provide uncertainty associated
  with deep learning predictions.
  Leveraging our expertise in Bayesian inversion
and uncertainty quantification (UQ) we shall develop a model-constrained Bayesian approaches to quantity the uncertainty in deep learning solutions
