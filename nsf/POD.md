### Major Activities 
The research aim is to extend the exponential convergence rate algorithm, developed by Shamir [1]. In particular, the algorithm is able to find the first eigenvector of the data matrix with exponential rate. In this research, we aim to develop an algorithm for finding the multiple eigenvetors of a matrix simultaneously with the same convergence rate.

### Significant Results
The reproduced result is the same as that in the paper.

The developed algorithm is promising, although we still are not able to achieve the consistent convergence. Hence, the further research is needed.
