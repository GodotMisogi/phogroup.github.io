### Major Activities 
The research is aim to extend the exponential-rate convergence algorithm, developed by Shami [1]. In particular, the algorithm is able to find out the first eigenvector of the data matrix with exponential rate. In this research, we aim to develop the algorithm for finding the multiple engenvetors of matrix simultaneously with the same convergence rate.


### Significant Results
The reproduced result is the same as that in the paper.

The developed algorithm is promising, although we still are not able to achieve the consistent convergence. Hence, the further research is needed.
